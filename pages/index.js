            If you're a resident of Wilton, New York, you know how important it is to have safe and accessible pedestrian pathways throughout our community. Multi-use paths provide a great opportunity to improve connectivity, promote healthy living, and activate our streets both socially and economically.

By signing our petition, you can help make this a reality without any additional burden on taxpayers.
Moreover, multi-use paths offer a range of benefits beyond just transportation. They promote healthy lifestyles by encouraging walking, running, and biking, and they create a sense of community by bringing people together in shared public spaces. Additionally, multi-use paths can be a catalyst for economic activity, attracting businesses and boosting property values in the surrounding area.

We believe that investing in multi-use paths is a smart and worthwhile endeavor for our community. And with your help, we can make it happen without raising taxes. So if you're passionate about creating a more connected, healthy, and vibrant community in Wilton, please sign our petition and join us in this effort.

            <p>
            In phase one of our proposal, we aim to install multi-use paths on Gick/Jones Road, extending from NY-29 to Route 50, and Maple Ave (NYS Route 9), extending from NY-29 to just past Spring Run. Phase two would include adding multi-use paths to Carr Road, Davidson Drive, and Northern Pines Road, extending from Maple Ave to Lonesome Pine Trail. Our primary focus is on providing safe neighborhood accessibility to Gavin Park, Dorothy Nolan Elementary School, and Maple Avenue Middle School.

                This might have been true in the past, but research published in 2012 by the U.S.
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention7 (CDC) and in 2013 by the National Center
                for Safe Routes to School8 shows that a growing number of people are walking, and
                that many are children and adults age 65 and older. People just need safe,
                convenient and pleasant places near their homes, schools and workplaces to make
                walking routine, says the CDC study.

              <p>
                Perhaps, or maybe they‚Äôre driving so much because there are no multi-use paths! Federal
                data on vehicle miles traveled and a recent national study show a decline in driving
                and car ownership during the 2000s in an overwhelming majority of metro areas. At
                the same time, the number of people commuting by bicycle and transit increased.9 A
                survey by the Surface Transportation Policy Partnership found that 55 percent of
                Americans would prefer to walk more and drive less.

                Not necessarily. Multi-use paths can be curved to avoid trees. In fact, protecting a tree
                is one of the few reasons for a multi-use paths to deviate from a direct route.

                Many homeowners don‚Äôt realize how far from the curb their private property line
                actually extends. There‚Äôs often enough of a public right-of-way easement in place to

                they can already see from their cars or by walking along the edge of the street. Any

                Actually, increased pedestrian activity puts more eyes on the street and creates

                Since multi-use paths increase property values and tax revenues, they serve as an economic
                engine. Plus, multi-use paths maintenance costs are real estate tax-deductible (IRS
