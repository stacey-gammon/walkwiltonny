            Sidewalks play a vital role in community life. As a way for pedestrian movement and
            access, they enhance connectivity and promote walking. As public spaces, sidewalks are
            the front steps to a community, activating streets both socially and economically.

                This might have been true in the past, but research published in 2012 by the U.S.
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention7 (CDC) and in 2013 by the National Center
                for Safe Routes to School8 shows that a growing number of people are walking, and
                that many are children and adults age 65 and older. People just need safe,
                convenient and pleasant places near their homes, schools and workplaces to make
                walking routine, says the CDC study.

                Perhaps, or maybe they‚Äôre driving so much because there are no sidewalks! Federal
                data on vehicle miles traveled and a recent national study show a decline in driving
                and car ownership during the 2000s in an overwhelming majority of metro areas. At
                the same time, the number of people commuting by bicycle and transit increased.9 A
                survey by the Surface Transportation Policy Partnership found that 55 percent of
                Americans would prefer to walk more and drive less.

                Not necessarily. Sidewalks can be curved to avoid trees. In fact, protecting a tree
                is one of the few reasons for a sidewalk to deviate from a direct route.

                Many homeowners don‚Äôt realize how far from the curb their private property line
                actually extends. There‚Äôs often enough of a public right-of-way easement in place to

              <p>
                There‚Äôs little difference between what passersby can see from a sidewalk versus what
                they can already see from their cars or by walking along the edge of the street. Any
                nearness added by a sidewalk would likely be as little as a just a few feet.

                Actually, increased pedestrian activity puts more eyes on the street and creates

                Since sidewalks increase property values and tax revenues, they serve as an economic
                engine. Plus, sidewalk maintenance costs are real estate tax-deductible (IRS
                Publication 530). Sidewalks are also safety investments (by bringing more eyes and
                ears to the street) and an integral part of a balanced transportation budget

                <a href="http://www.walkscore.com">Walk Score</a> is an online logarithmic ranking
                system that determines the basic walkability of a residential or commercial
                property. Walk Score uses neighborhood factors such as distance to shops and schools
                to create a number between 0 and 100 that measures the walkability of any address.
